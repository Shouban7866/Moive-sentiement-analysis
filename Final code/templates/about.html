        <h2>About MovieSent</h2>

        <p>
            <strong>MovieSent</strong> is a movie review sentiment analysis project that uses
            Machine Learning and Deep Learning to classify reviews as
            <strong>Positive</strong> or <strong>Negative</strong>.
            The goal of this project is to show how text data can be analyzed using AI.
        </p>

        <h2>How the Project Was Created</h2>
        <p>
            This project was built step-by-step using simple and commonly used AI techniques.
            Here is a short explanation of how the system was created:
        </p>

        <h3>1. Collecting Movie Reviews</h3>
        <p>
            The project started with collecting a dataset of movie reviews
            where each review had a sentiment label (positive or negative).
        </p>

        <h3>2. Cleaning and Preparing the Text</h3>
        <p>
            Before training any model, all reviews were cleaned using basic NLP steps such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>removing HTML tags</li>
            <li>converting text to lowercase</li>
            <li>removing stopwords</li>
            <li>tokenization</li>
            <li>lemmatization</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Training Two Different Models</h3>
        <p>
            To make the system powerful, two AI models were trained:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Logistic Regression (ML Model):</strong> trained using TF-IDF features.</li>
            <li><strong>LSTM Neural Network (Deep Learning Model):</strong> trained using token sequences.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Building the Web Application</h3>
        <p>
            After training the models, a simple and fast web application was created using Flask.
            The user writes a review → text is preprocessed → selected model predicts the sentiment instantly.
        </p>

        <h2>Benefits of This Project</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Real-time Analysis:</strong> Users get instant sentiment predictions.</li>
            <li><strong>High Accuracy:</strong> Uses both ML & Deep Learning for better results.</li>
            <li><strong>Educational Value:</strong> Great example of how NLP and AI work together.</li>
            <li><strong>User-Friendly:</strong> Clean and easy-to-use web interface.</li>
            <li><strong>Practical Application:</strong> Can be extended to product reviews, social media posts, feedback systems, etc.</li>
            <li><strong>Lightweight Web App:</strong> Can run on any computer with Python.</li>
            <li><strong>Shows Full AI Pipeline:</strong> From data cleaning to model training to deployment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            MovieSent is a simple, effective, and complete AI project that demonstrates
            how text sentiment analysis works in real life using modern machine learning techniques.
